# Koding 4 Kids
I created Koding 4 Kids because I believe every child should have the opportunity to learn coding, no matter where they come from. I live in Minnesota, a state that ranks dead last in computer science education, and I want to change that. As a first-generation person of color in college, I know how important access to tech education is. Thatâ€™s why I built this platform to make coding fun, interactive, and accessible for kids at an early age!
